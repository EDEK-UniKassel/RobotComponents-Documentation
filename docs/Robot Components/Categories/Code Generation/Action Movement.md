## Description

[Code Generation]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/Robot Components/Categories/Code Generation/index.md %}): Defines a linear or nonlinear movement instruction for simulation and RAPID main code generation.

## Input Parameter

**Target**: Defines the movement target. A target can be generated by using an Action: Target component. Depending on the type of movement, a suffix will be added to all targets in RAPIDCode. This can be either “_jt” for jointTarget in case of a joint movement or “_rt” for robTarget in case of a linear movement.

**Speed Data**: Defines the speed data for the robot movement instruction. A Speed Data can be generated by using an Action: Speed Data component.

**IsLinear**: Defines if the robot movement is linear or nonlinear based on a boolean value. The robot movement is nonlinear by default. Linear movements cannot be simulated reliably in Robot Components but only approximated. Their correct behavior can only be validated in a virtual or real ABB IRC5 robot controller.

**Precision**: Defines the movement precision, also called zone data, in mm based on an integer value. Can be set to -1, 0, 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 80, 100, 150, 200. More information on this topic can be found [here](http://developercenter.robotstudio.com/landing).

Note: If this value equals “-1” the precision is interpreted as “fine”.

## Output Parameter

**Movement**: Contains the movement instructions as Action for simulation and RAPID main code generation.

## Usage

[Code Generation]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/Robot Components/Categories/Code Generation/index.md %}): Plug the Movement output of this component into the Actions input of the RAPID Generator component to generate a single robot movement instruction in the RAPID Main Code.
