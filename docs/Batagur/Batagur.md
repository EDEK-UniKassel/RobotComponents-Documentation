# **{{page.title}}**

Batagur is a set of Components for Rhino/Grasshopper which connects to [MoveIt](https://moveit.ros.org/){:target="_blank"}/[ROS](https://www.ros.org/){:target="_blank"} for accessing complex Pathplanning form inside Grasshopper. Batagur is integrated with the Grasshopper addin RobotComponents, which is also developed at the Department of Experimental and Digital Design and Construction at the University of Kassel
To make this workflow as convenient and seamless as possible, Batagur is using the default MoveIt message types.
Moreover, Batagur is built on top of a c# library 
"ROSMessageLib" which wraps around many ROS massages. Therfore, it is easy to recreate the functionality of Batagur in other Software solutions, for example, Unity3D.

## **Features**

* Uses of Native ROS / MoveIt Message types
* Base Library to be used in other software solutions.
* Intuitive to Use
