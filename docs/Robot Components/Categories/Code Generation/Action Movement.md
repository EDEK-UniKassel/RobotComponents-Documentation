# **Movement**

## **Description**

[**Code Generation**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/Robot Components/Categories/Code Generation/index.md %})**:** Defines a linear or nonlinear movement instruction for simulation and RAPID main code generation.

## **Input Parameters**

**Target (T):** Defines the movement target. A target can be generated by using an Action: Target component. Depending on the type of movement, a suffix will be added to all targets in RAPIDCode. This can be either “_jt” for jointTarget in case of a joint movement or “_rt” for robTarget in case of a linear movement.

**Speed Data (SD):** Defines the speed data for the robot movement instruction. A Speed Data can be generated by using an Action: Speed Data component.

**Movement Type (MT):**

**Zone Data (Z):** Defines the movement precision, also called zone data, in mm based on an integer value. Can be set to -1, 0, 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 80, 100, 150, 200. More information on this topic can be found [here](http://developercenter.robotstudio.com/landing). Note: If this value equals “-1” the precision is interpreted as “fine”.

**Overwrite Robot Tool (RT):**

**Overwrite Work Object (WO):**

**Digital Output (DO):**

## **Output Parameters**

**Movement:** Contains the movement instructions as Action for simulation and RAPID main code generation.

## **Usage**

[**Code Generation**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/Robot Components/Categories/Code Generation/index.md %})**:** Plug the Movement output of this component into the Actions input of the RAPID Generator component to generate a single robot movement instruction in the RAPID Main Code.
