## Description

[Code Generation]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/Robot Components/Categories/Code Generation/index.md %}): Defines an aboslute joint movement instruction for simulation and RAPID code generation.

## Input Parameter

**Name (N)**: Defines the name of the joint target for this absolute joint movement based on a string value. The name should be unique. The first letter shouldn’t be a number. Don’t use special characters or spaces.

**Internal Axis Values (IAV)**: Defines the internal axis values of the robot based on a list with 6 numbers. The axis values has to be defined in degrees. 

**Exernal Axis Values (EAV)**: Defines the external axis values of the attached external axes based on a list with numbers. The list length should be equal to the number of external axes that are attached to the robot. In case no external axes are used the input can be left empty. For an external linear axis the axis value should be defined in mm. For a rotational external axis the external axis value should be defined in degrees. 

**Speed Data (SD)**: Defines the speed data for the robot movement instruction. A Custom Speed Data can be generated by using an Action: Speed Data component or a number value can be used as an input. Only predefined speeddata values defined by ABB are allowed as number input. 

**Override Robot Tool (RT)**: Defines the robot tool that will be used for the defined movement. If this input is left empty the robot tool that is attached to the used robot info will be used. This input it OPTIONAL and can be accessed through the right-click menu of the component. 

## Output Parameter

**Absolute Joint Movement (AJM)**: Contains the absolute joint movement instructions as Action for simulation and RAPID code generation.

## Usage

[**Code Generation**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/Robot Components/Categories/Code Generation/index.md %}): Plug the Absolute Joint Movement output of this component into the Actions input of the RAPID Generator component to define the instruction in a RAPID program.
