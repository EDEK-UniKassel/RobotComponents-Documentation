# **Robot Components**

## **Categories**

[**Code Generation**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/Robot Components/Categories/Code Generation/index.md %})**:** These components are used to generate the RAPID main and base code for an ABB IRC5 robot controller which can be copied manually or uploaded and run by using Controller Utility components. Furthermore, movement instructions can be simulated visually in Rhino by using Simulation components.

[**Controller Utility**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/Robot Components/Categories/Controller Utility/index.md %})**:** These components are used to build up a real-time connection to an ABB IRC5 robot controller.

[**Deconstruct**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/Robot Components/Categories/Deconstruct/index.md %})**:**

[**Definitions**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/Robot Components/Categories/Definitions/index.md %})**:** These components are used to define robots and robot tools which are needed for Code Generation and Simulation.

[**Simulation**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/Robot Components/Categories/Simulation/index.md %})**:** These components are used to visually approximate the movement behavior of the robot before running the RAPID main and base code on an ABB IRC5 robot controller.

[**Utility**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/Robot Components/Categories/Utility/index.md %})**:** These components support other component categories with extra functionality.
