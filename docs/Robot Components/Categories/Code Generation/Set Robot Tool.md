## Description

Code Generation: This component defines an instruction to change the current robot tool of the ABB robot for RAPID base code generation.

## Input Parameter

Robot Tool: Defines the robot tool. A robot tool can be generated by using a Robot Tool From Planes or Robot Tools From Data component.

## Output Parameter

Set Robot Tool: Contains the instruction to change the robot tool to the defined robot tool as an Action for RAPID main code generation.

## Usage

Code Generation: Plug the Set Robot Tool output of this component into the RAPID Generator component to generate a single code line in the RAPID main code that sets the currently used robot tool. The currently used robot tool should be defined in RAPID base code. This is done automatically when creating a Robot Tool From Planes or Robot Tools From Data component. Each robot tool name needs to be unique.
