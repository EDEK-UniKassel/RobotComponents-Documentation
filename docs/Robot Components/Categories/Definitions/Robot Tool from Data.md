## Description

Work in progess....

Definitions: This component defines a robot tool based on translation and rotation values. It will be automatically registered in the RAPID base code of any RAPID Generator component.

## Input Parameter

Name: Defines the robot tool name base on a Panel or any other string value. This name must be unique and shouldnâ€™t start with a number or use special characters.

Mesh: Defines the robot tool mesh based on a mesh.

Translation X: Defines the X Translation of the robot tool effector based on a double value.

Translation Y: Defines the Y Translation of the robot tool effector based on a double value.

Translation Z: Defines the Z Translation of the robot tool effector based on a double value.

Rotation X: Defines the X Rotation of the robot tool effector based on a double value.

Rotation Y: Defines the Y Rotation of the robot tool effector based on a double value.

Rotation Z: Defines the Z Rotation of the robot tool effector based on a double value.

## Output Parameter

Robot Tool: Contains the robot tool information.

Robot Tool String: Contains the robot tool information as a string for the RAPID base code. More information on that topic can be found here: Introduction to RAPID or in the Technial Reference Manual of ABB Robotics.

## Usage

Definitions: Plug the Robot Tool output of this component into the Robot Tool input of a ABB_IRB-1200-7-0.7 or any other Robot Info component. The robot tool will be mounted to the mounting frame of the robot.

Code Generation: Plug the Robot Tool output of this component into the Robot Tool input of a Action: Set Robot Tool component to define an instruction for RAPID base code generation that defines the currently used robot tool.
